* `sandbox` {Object}

If given a `sandbox` object, the `vm.createContext()` method will [prepare
that sandbox][contextified] so that it can be used in calls to
[`vm.runInContext()`][] or [`script.runInContext()`][]. Inside such scripts,
the `sandbox` object will be the global object, retaining all of its existing
properties but also having the built-in objects and functions any standard
[global object][] has. Outside of scripts run by the vm module, `sandbox` will
remain unchanged.

If `sandbox` is omitted (or passed explicitly as `undefined`), a new, empty
[contextified][] sandbox object will be returned.

The `vm.createContext()` method is primarily useful for creating a single
sandbox that can be used to run multiple scripts. For instance, if emulating a
web browser, the method can be used to create a single sandbox representing a
window's global object, then run all `<script>` tags together within the context
of that sandbox.
